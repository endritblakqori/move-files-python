# move-files-python
Run 
```move_files.py``` 
and it will ask for source folder url where your files are located, and destination folder where you
want to move your files. While moving files it will sort files based on their extensions and create folders for each
type if the folder doesn't exist. 

You can change or add more file extensions.
